	  Like <a href="//web.mit.edu/6.115/www/">6.115</a>, 6.947 is a chance to remember why you came to <span class={smallCaps}>mit</span>: to learn and to build.
	  Whereas 6.115 focuses on constructing digital systems from compositions of discrete integrated circuits, however, weâ€™ll be focusing on functional programming &ndash; constructing software systems from compositions of discrete mathematical functions.
	  Prepare to leave behind everything you've ever known about programming and enter a world of functors, combinators, and monads; a world without borders or boundaries; <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyRW9uFSmh0">a world where anything is possible</a>.
